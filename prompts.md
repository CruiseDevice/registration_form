# AI - Assisted Development Process Documentation

## Project Overview
**Project**: User Registration Application
**Tech Stack**: Python FastAPI + React TypeScript
**Development Approach**: Multi-platform AI assistance

---

## 1. Initial Project Planning
### Platform: Claude Web Interface
### Purpose Requirements gathering and prompt refinement

### My initial request:
I am trying to create a registration form using Python and React. I have attached the prompt details which i came up with. Can you write me a prompt for the same which I can give to claude code to build the project.

### Initial requirements I provided:
I want to build a small registration app with Python as a backend and React (TypeScript) as a frontend.
The overview is as follows:
  - I want user registration with strict validation.
  - I want a user profile page to view or edit user profile details.
  - I want a welcome page that greets the user (e.g, "Hello, Akash!") after login.

I want to focus on UI/UX, correctness and clean architecture. 

Core Requirements
  - Functional
    1. Registration Form (React - TypeScript)
      - It should have fields: First Name, Last Name, Work Email, Password, Confirm Password.
      - It should validate inline with clear messages.
      - Email must be @getcovered.io
      - Password rules are as follows:
        - >= 12 characters
        - It should use uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol
        - should not use repeated characters (3+)
        - differs from email local part by >= 5 chars
      - the submit button should be disabled until valid.

    2. Backend API (Python)
      - Use FastAPI
      - Endpoint: POST /api/register to create user; hash passwords
      - Persist users to SQLite database; enforce unique email.

    3. Fake Data:
      - Seed 10 fake users with @getcovered.io emails.

    4. Profile Management:
      - Profie Page: After registration or login, users can view their details.
      - Edit Profile: Update first/last name. Email is read-only.
      - Backend routes: GET /api/profile, PUT /api/profile.

    5. Welcome Page:
      - After successful login or registration, redirect to a page saying: "Hello {firstName}".

    6. Docs:
      - Add README with detailed setup, detailed run steps, detailed design notes.

UI/UX Expectations
Create a user registration form component with excellent UI/UX design that follows these specifications:

Form Structure:
  - Email address field
  - Password field with confirmation
  - Full name (first and last name fields)
  - Phone number (optional)
  - Terms and conditions checkbox
  - Sign up button
  - Link to existing account login

Design Requirements:
  - Modern, responsive layout that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
  - Clean, professional appearance suitable for a SaaS application
  - Use a card-based layout with subtle elevation (border, not drop shadow)
  - Implement proper visual hierarchy through typography sizes
  - Include clear field labels with proper accessibility attributes
  - Minimal, visually pleasing design approach

Validation & Feedback Requirements:
  - Inline error messages that appear directly below each field
  - Success feedback for valid inputs (green indicators or checkmarks)
  - Show validation states (error, success, neutral) with appropriate colors
  - Error messages positioned clearly near relevant fields without disrupting layout

Password Features (Required):
  - Password strength meter with visual indicator (weak/medium/strong)
  - Show/hide password toggle button for both password fields
  - Real-time strength feedback as user types

Visual Style Constraints:
  - Color palette: one primary color (your choice), white, and shades of gray
  - NO gradients, NO glassmorphism, NO heavy shadows
  - Typography: use system fonts or web-safe fonts
  - Spacing: generous whitespace for better readability
  - Borders: use solid 1px borders, avoid rounded corners over 4px

Accessibility Requirements (Critical):
  - Proper ARIA labels and roles for all form elements
  - Full keyboard navigation support with logical tab order
  - Screen reader compatibility with descriptive labels
  - Semantic HTML structure with proper form associations
  - Mobile-friendly touch targets (minimum 44px height)
  - High contrast colors for text readability

Interactive States:
  - Loading state for the submit button
  - Clear visual feedback for form validation
  - Hover and focus states for all interactive elements
  - Disabled states when form is processing

Focus on creating something that looks professional, accessible, and trustworthy rather than trendy. Ensure all accessibility features are properly implemented.

Technical Constraints
  - Frontend: React (TypeScript), Tailwind
  - FastAPI
  - SQLite for storage; seed the data into sqlite via script.

API Endpoints
  - Register: POST /api/register
  - Profile: GET /api/profile, PUT /api/profile"

why am i facing this issue? I already have a fastapi installed in the current conda environment. Can you help me find out what is the issue? Also, make sure to activate the "registration" conda environment before testing it

#### Issue #2: React Module Resolution.

**Problem**: Module not found error for './App'
I am getting this error in the frontend in the browser. Can you help me find out what is the error and help me fix it? Can you check if any related file is missing? The module is present in the given path, is react not configured correctly?
ERROR in ./src/index.tsx 6:0-24
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './App' in '/Users/akash/work/github/registration_form/frontend/src'


#### Issue #3: Bcrypt version warning

**Problem**: AttributeError with bcrypt version detection

**My Query:**
When running the seed_data script i am getting a attribute error, but also it shows that the users are created successfully? 
"(registration) ➜  backend python seed_data.py

🎉 Successfully created 10 fake users!

All users have passwords that meet the requirements:
- At least 12 characters
- Contains uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol
- No repeated characters (3+ consecutive)
- Different from email local part by at least 5 characters

You can now test the application with any of these credentials.
Example login:
Email: john.smith@getcovered.io
Password: SecurePass123!@#

I confirmed that the users are created successfully, but why does this error occur? Let me know if you want to perform any operation on the database before proceeding to make any changes.

## 4. Environment Configuration

### Platform: Cursor AI Assistant
### Purpose: Implementing centralized configuration

**My Query**
I have currently created a .env file in the backend's root directory. I want to use the variables defined in the .env file in @auth.py @auth.py and @database.py
